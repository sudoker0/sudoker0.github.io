            p #[b Rules: ] We'll give you a random GIF (which is obtained from Tenor), and a list of 12 random tags. Your job is to select the tag which best describe the GIF. Each correct tag will increase your point by 20, while each wrong tag will decrease your point by 40 (only after you select at least 3 wrong tags).
            p #[b Notes: ] It's recommended for you to get an API key (it's like an access key) to use Tenor (which is the GIF provider this website use) because of something called "rate limiting" #[a(href="https://developers.google.com/tenor/guides/rate-limits-and-caching#rate-limits") (more info)]. Of course you can still continue without an API key, but if you do, then you might encounter a lot of error dialog becuase of, again, rate limiting. #[a(href="./help_get_api/") To know how you can get your own API key, click here!]
