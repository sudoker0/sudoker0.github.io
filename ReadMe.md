## Welcome to my first ever repository and also my first ever website (And also my favourite repository) in GitHub.

> Important Note: The domain `https://quanmcpc.site` is privately funded and not by me funded.

### I. Why do I need a website?
They're the best way to show my work to the world. Also because it's fun to create one, even if no one gonna see it.

### II. What tool did I use?
- For writing source code: Visual Studio Code (And Sublime Text sometimes)
- For making SVG graphics: Inkscape
- For making PNG images: Paint.net
- For testing website: Firefox
- For publishing website: GitHub Pages
- Some other tool includes: Git, GitHub Actions, etc.

### III. Can you provide us with technical details?

### V. Random stuff
> One of my quotes
```
The only reason I tried to minimize accessibility issues is to avoid seeing errors and warnings on the accessibility checker tool.
```
> JavaScript Loop Code
```JavaScript
while(1) {
    console.log("Loop!");
}
```
> Python Loop Code
```Python
while True:
    print("Loop!")
```
> C++ Loop Code
```c++
for( ; ; ) {
    cout << "Loop!" << endl;
}
```
> I forgot what is this language but I can tell you, this is a loop code
```basic
10 PRINT "Loop!"
20 GOTO 10
```
> MCPC in my username is acronym and it can mean a lot of things:
```nim
 - MineCraft for Personal Computer (The correct one)
 - May Center around Piece of Crap (When something's a bit broke)
 - My Cock is Pissed-off from Coding (When something really broke)
 - Might Code for Poor Coder (When something work)
```
