### üìï Introduction
* Ok, I have to tell the truth: This repository was not the first-ever repo I created. The first one that I created is used to store the game I made using Unity, and then I removed that same repo because I still want my game to be private.
* After removing that, I rarely use GitHub. Then one day, I decided to create my first ever website because I wanted one, and so I found an [article on Medium](https://medium.com/@svinkle/publish-and-share-your-own-website-for-free-with-github-2eff049a1cb5) that helps you create a free website on GitHub. So after some hard work, my very first website was born!
* **Note**: When I first created the website, my original GitHub nickname was Quan215, so the name of my website was Quan215.github.io. Then I changed my nickname to my Minecraft username because remembering so many user names is hard. I also have to change the repository name to the current website name to make my website work.
### üí° About
- My website is not the best looking, but it's good enough for me. And don't worry, I will try to improve my website while learning new things too!
### üìñ Details
- I use programming languages such as HTML, JS, and CSS to create this website. And why I didn't use PHP or another language? Simply because:
    - GitHub does not support parsing PHP, ASP.
    - I like to keep my website **pure** HTML and JS.
- There are currently five pages* on my website:
    - Home: This is the page that you'll see first when you enter my website, which contains:
        - A little introduction about myself
        - Social links
        - Self-rating on programming languages that I knew
        - A long list of all of my project
    - Credit: This page shows a list of software and webpage that help with the website, containing:
        - Links to the software that helps create this website
        - Links to the webpage that help with the website
    - About Website: This shows a lot of information about my website in both table and text form, which contains:
        - A table show information like the file size, number of commits, etc.
        - A chart that shows the number of commits per week starting from the creation of the website.
        - Another table displays detailed information on every commits ever created.
    - Gallery: Gallery: Show a list of screenshots of some of my Minecraft projects, containing:
        - A UI to navigate and view the picture
    - Download: Download stuff that I allow people to download. Wait, that's a lie, everything on my website is free to download and use, and it's all legal. By the way, this page contains:
        - A list of free to download and use files.
- \* There is some page like the Loading page, basic HTML version of the page that I didn't mention. But I'll still mention some of those pages for no reason at all:
    - Basic HTML version:
        - No custom font
        - Basic styling
        - Accessed through the loading page
    - Loading page (index.html):
        - An animated SVG (or GIF if the SVG one failed to load)
        - And ~~three~~ two links:
            - One redirects to the main version.
            - Another one redirects to the lite version.
            - ~~And the final one redirects to the first-ever revision of the website.~~
    - ~~First version:~~ (This part of the website has moved to [https://quan215.github.io](https://quan215.github.io))
        - ~~Very basic (only contain 4KB of HTML file, 6MB of image)~~
        - ~~Almost no styling~~
### ‚ùì FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
- Will I ever stop working on the website?
    - **Maybe**, I mean I have other things in life to do, for example: Go to school, play with my friend and do other things. Don't worry about it tho, since it will take very long to happen.
- Will I ever purchase my domain?
    - **Yes**, but in the far future.
- Have I ever encountered problems when making a website?
    - **Yes**, I have. When I add or change something, it might cause a problem, and if that happens, I will search on the Internet to find a solution.
- If GitHub supports PHP or other languages, will I ever use those languages to write my website?
    - **Maybe**, but I will probably prefer to stay on HTML, mainly because that means I have to learn a new language and adapt all of the different syntax and other things.
