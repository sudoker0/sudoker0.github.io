                    hr
                    p I'm a #[span.tc-blue web developer] and an #[span.tc-blue average programmer] living in #[span.tc-red Vietnam]. I mainly focus on #[span.tc-green front-end development] but can also work with #[span.tc-green back-end development], like my website, blog site, API, or programs that run on browsers.
                    p That said, I also have #[span.tc-cyan experience] in #[span.tc-purple game-making] (Unity, Godot), #[span.tc-purple GUI apps] (Tauri, Electron, C#), and #[span.tc-purple mobile apps] (Flutter). However, it's not my main focus right now.
                    p Since I believe in freedom, all my projects are #[span.tc-red Free and Open-Source], so you can contribute to the repository, use it somewhere else, or do whatever you want with it.
